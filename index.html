  <p> General elections will be held in India from 19 April 2024 to 1 June 2024 to elect the 543 members of the 18th Lok
    Sabha. The elections will be held in seven phases and the results will be announced on 4 June 2024. This will be the

    elections in the country with a total span of 44 days (excluding the first general election). The incumbent Prime
    Minister, Narendra Modi will be contesting elections for a third consecutive term. Approximately 960 million
    individuals out of a population of 1.4 billion are eligible to participate in the elections, which are expected to
    span a month for completion. The Legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh,
    Odisha and Sikkim will be held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 35 seats
    among 16 states.

  <h1> About 2019 Elections</h1>
  <p>General elections were held in India in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to elect the members of the 17th
    Lok Sabha. Votes were counted and the result was declared on 23 May. Around 912 million people were eligible to
    vote, and voter turnout was over 67 per cent the highest ever, as well as the highest ever participation by women
    voters. The Bharatiya Janata Party received 37.36% of the vote, the highest vote share by a political party since
    the 1989 general election, and won 303 seats, further increasing its substantial majority.[8] In addition, the
    BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 353 seats. The BJP won 37.76% of votes, while the NDA's combined vote
    was 45% of the 603.7 million votes that were polled. The Indian National Congress won 52 seats, failing to get 10%
    of the seats needed to claim the post of Leader of the Opposition. In addition, the Congress-led United Progressive
    Alliance (UPA) won 91 seats, while other parties won 98 seats. Legislative assembly elections in the states of
    Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, as well as
    by-elections of twenty-two seats of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.</p>

  <h1> Narendra Modi & Amit Shah</h1>
  <p> Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950 is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister
    of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament
    (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),
    a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from
    outside the Indian National Congress.</p><br>
  <p>
    Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions,
    individual rights, and freedom of expression. As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.
    Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a
    controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the
    Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Amit Anil Chandra Shah (born 22 October 1964) is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the 31st Minister
    of Home Affairs since 2019 and the 1st Minister of Co-operation of India since 2021. He served as the 10th President
    of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from 2014 to 2020. He has also served as chairman of the National Democratic
    Alliance (NDA) since 2014. He was elected to the lower house of Parliament, Lok Sabha, in the 2019 Indian general
    elections from Gandhinagar. Earlier, he had been elected as a member of the upper house of Parliament, Rajya Sabha,
    from Gujarat from 2017 to 2019.
  </p> <br>
  <p>
    Shah was the BJP's in-charge for India's largest and politically most crucial state, Uttar Pradesh, during the 2014
    Lok Sabha elections. The BJP-led NDA won 73 out of 80 seats. As a result, Shah rose to national prominence and was
    appointed as the party's national president in July 2014. He has played an organising and membership-promotional
    role in the elections of many states since 2014. In his initial two years, the BJP achieved success in Legislative
    Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and Assam but lost ground in Delhi and the
    large eastern state of Bihar in 2015.

    In 2017, he was partly credited with the party victories in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Manipur, but the
    Akali-BJP alliance lost power in the larger Punjab election. In 2018, the party lost power in the states of
    Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. A year later, the BJP won 303 seats to get a majority in the 2019 Indian
    general election under Shah's leadership.

  <h1> Past leadership of BJP</h1>
  <p> Although the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were
    identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president.[58] Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that
    the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu
    nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata
    Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism.[59] This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the
    elections of 1984.[59] The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the
    Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.[60]</p>
