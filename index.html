      <h1> About General Election of 2024</h1>
      <p> General elections will be held in India from 19 April 2024 to 1 June 2024 to elect the 543 members of the 18th
        Lok Sabha. The elections will be held in seven phases and the results will be announced on 4 June 2024. This
        will be the largest-ever election in the world, surpassing the 2019 general elections and will be the
        longest-held general elections in the country with a total span of 44 days (excluding the first general
        election). The incumbent Prime Minister, Narendra Modi will be contesting elections for a third consecutive
        term.

        Approximately 960 million individuals out of a population of 1.4 billion are eligible to participate in the
        eagerly awaited elections, which are expected to span a month for completion.[1]

        The Legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim will be
        held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 35 seats among 16 states.</p>

      <h1> 2024 Election vs 2019 Election</h1>
      <p> General elections were held in India in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to elect the members of the
        17th Lok Sabha. Votes were counted and the result was declared on 23 May. Around 912 million people were
        eligible to vote, and voter turnout was over 67 percent the highest ever, as well as the highest ever
        participation by women voters. <br>

        The Bharatiya Janata Party received 37.36% of the vote, the highest vote share by a political party since the
        1989 general election, and won 303 seats, further increasing its substantial majority. In addition, the BJP-led
        National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 353 seats. The BJP won 37.76% of votes, while the NDA's combined vote was
        45% of the 603.7 million votes that were polled. The Indian National Congress won 52 seats, failing to get 10%
        of the seats needed to claim the post of Leader of the Opposition. In addition, the Congress-led United
        Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 91 seats, while other parties won 98 seats.

        Legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim were held
        simultaneously with the general election, as well as by-elections of twenty-two seats of the Tamil Nadu
        Legislative Assembly. </p>
